in C++, the separation between statements is specified with an ending semicolon (;), with the separation into different lines not mattering at all for this purpose. many statements can be written in a single line, or each statement can be in its own line. the division of code in different lines serves only to make it more legible and schematic for the humans that may read it, but has no effect on the actual behavior of the program.
